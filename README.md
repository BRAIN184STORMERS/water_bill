# water_bill

This is a console based Water bill calculator that calculates the water bill based on the usage type and the amount of water consumption. HOW WE BUILT THIS APP We created a user friendly interface where the user can input his or her name,then the user is directed to an interface where he or she is to specify the usage type and finally input the amount of water consumed in that certain month. We then implemented a billing algorithm that accurately calculates water bills based on water consumption and the water rate structures without displaying any errors whatsoever. REQUIREMENTS No special requirements.
